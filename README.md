# SeamCarver
The project aims to implement a simple image resizing application (with GUI) using method called <strong>seam carving</strong>. Instead of simply cropping columns/rows of an image, this method relies on finding vertical/horizontal paths of pixels of the smallest total energy (“importance”). It ensures fair visual coherency even after rescaling.
